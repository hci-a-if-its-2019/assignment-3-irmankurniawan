# Usability Evaluation and Prototyping (again)
> Usability Evaluation in this assignment is to evaluate your high-fidelity interactive-prototype with two participants:
> the participant from the previous Contextual Inquiry (CI) 
> and an additional novice-participant with different demographics if possible.
> Respectively, revise your prototype as an attempt to fix any problems found in this Usability Evaluation.

## Operating the Prototype
> Record a video (screen-recording is preferred) while you operating your prototype.
> Present the ideal case on how to interact with the prototype from the beginning to the end.
> Upload the video on any video-sharing website (e.g., YouTube), then attach the video link on this report.

## Part A: Usability Evaluation
> In this part, you should prepare your high-fidelity interactive-prototype from the assignment 2.
> Invite the participant from your previous CI to test the prototype.
> You also need to invite one more novice participant.
> As with the CI, you might need to videotape your sessions.
> You can benefit from the videotape while writing your `Recording Transcript` later.

### 1. Brief Description of Participants
> Describe your participants in bullets or sentences.
> The description should contain their demographic (age, gender, occupation),
> their skill level in using the system, and your reasons choosing them.
> The description should NOT contain any personally identifiable information.

#### a. Description of Participant 1
 - A girl, 21 years old
 - College Student
 - Use internet for browsing and doing assignment
 - Previous CI participant

#### b. Description of Participant 2
 - A man, about 31 years old
 - Businness man
 - Using the internet mainly for chat with his businness partners

### 4. Feedback and Incidence Analysis

#### OBSERVATION 1
![Prototype Screen 1](image/HOMEPAGE.jpg)

 - **Reference**: Provide line-number(s) or time-code(s) referred by feedback/incidence observed on the screen.
 - **Feedback**: Provide feedback (positive or negative) given by the participants, if any.
 - **Incidence**: Critical incidences (breakdowns or problems encountered by the participants) and/or mistakes committed by the participants, if any.
 - **Reason**: Explain the reason for the breakdowns or the negative feedback observed on the screen.
 - **Resolution**: Suggest any modifications that might be made to the UI to address the issues in this `OBSERVATION 1`.
 
#### OBSERVATION 2
![Prototype Screen 2](image/PRODUCT_PAGE.jpg)

 - **Reference**: 
 - **Feedback**: 
 - **Incidence**: 
 - **Reason**: 
 - **Resolution**: Suggest any modifications that might be made to the UI to address the issues in this `OBSERVATION 2`.
 
#### OBSERVATION 3

 - **Reference**:  
 - **Feedback**: 
 - **Incidence**: 
 - **Reason**: 
 - **Resolution**: Suggest any modifications that might be made to the UI to address the issues in this `OBSERVATION 3`.
 
 ... and so on ...

## Part B: Prototyping (again)
> Next, you will need to modify your prototype 
> based on the resolutions you have suggested in `Feedback and Incidence Analysis`'s observations.

### Sketch
> Draw a sketch of your prototype that is refined based according to the aforementioned observations on a paper.
> Afterwards, scan the sketch or make the photograph of it and attach it on this report's section.
> Please make sure the any texts on the sketch are readable.

### Design Rationale
> Please write a paragraph expressing what you have learned from the usability evaluation, 
> and how it is reflected in your design.

### High-Fidelity Interactive-Prototype
> Create a high-fidelity interactive-prototype based on the `Sketch` you have drawn.
> You can use any prototyping tools: InVision, Adobe XD, or even Microsoft PowerPoint.
